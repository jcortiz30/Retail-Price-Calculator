Retail Price Calculator

This calculator is for Artists and Designers who make and sell handmade products. This programs allows you to add and remove a 
material, it's price and quantity to a list, add an overhead percentage and totals the list to find the wholesale and retail price.

I have JDK 11.0.1 installed on my computer. If you have older JDK it will cause an error message when trying to launch the file.

You can launch the program through the .jar file located in the classes folder, or the .exe file.
